Uff, this time without working was like an eternity to me... I repeated myself so many times "I will revive my blog this week/month/year" and guess what, time passed by.

But, you know, I couldn't avoid having all those thoughts during commuting or having a talk with any of my friends (especially after a talk or something) and saying to myself:  _"hey I should write a blog post about that!"_

Well, I am not dead yet... no more excuses, here we go...
